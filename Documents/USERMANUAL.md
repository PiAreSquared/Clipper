##  What is Clipper?

Have you ever missed a sports game because life got in the way, and had to wait hours for the highlight reels? Even when they finally arrived, they left you unsatisfiedâ€”just a series of clips with no context, abruptly cutting off in the middle. That's why we created Clipper, a tool for instant highlight generation using our custom algorithm. Plus, we overlay the highlights with AI-synthesized commentary, providing more context for plays and enhancing engagement. This solution revolutionizes highlight generation, eliminating the substantial human effort, inconsistency, and time consumption of traditional methods.
