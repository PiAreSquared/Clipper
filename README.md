# Introduction and Background

## Problem Statement

Creating compelling highlight reels or summaries of sports plays
involves time-consuming video editing and voiceover work, requiring
manual selection of key moments, cutting the video, and adding
narration. This process often demands extensive human effort, leading to
inefficiencies, time constraints, and potential inconsistencies in the
final output.  
  
To streamline and expedite this process, there’s a need for an AI-driven
solution that automates the compilation of sports play highlights. The
solution should incorporate advanced video analysis, automated video
cutting, and intelligent voiceover capabilities to efficiently generate
engaging highlight reels or summaries, reducing the manual effort and
ensuring consistency and quality in the final output.  

## Solution Statement

Our solution is designed specifically to cater to the fast-paced demands
of halftime sports analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies,
our platform enables instant creation of highlight reels during halftime
breaks or live sports events. Through real-time video analysis
algorithms, our system swiftly identifies and extracts key moments from
the ongoing game or match. These pivotal highlights are automatically
compiled into engaging and concise reels within moments, ensuring timely
availability for halftime analysis.  
  
Furthermore, our AI-driven voiceover functionality provides instant
narration or commentary, adding depth and context to the highlighted
plays. This feature facilitates comprehensive analysis and enhances
viewer engagement during the brief halftime window. The user-friendly
interface allows sports analysts or broadcasters to seamlessly access,
customize, and present these highlight reels within minutes, enabling
dynamic and informative halftime discussions. Our solution significantly
reduces the time and effort traditionally required for video editing and
voiceover work, ensuring that valuable halftime moments are maximized
for insightful analysis and audience engagement.  
  
Our systems would be trained using full-length sports games, producing
comprehensive highlight reels. Feedback from pre-existing shortened
games, such as those found on NBA or NFL YouTube channels, refines our
model’s grasp of impactful moments. This data, coupled with user
interactions like crowd noise, commentator tone/volume, and manual
labeling, enhances our machine learning algorithms. This iterative
process guarantees our system consistently delivers high-quality sports
play highlights.  

## Competitive Analysis

There is a definite interest in the field of AI-generated highlights,
and the idea has proven to be meritorious. Tools such as WSC Sports,
Magnifi, and Cognitive Mill are currently being utilized by sports
leagues and organizations to generate highlights of the most significant
moments of a game using AI. Additionally, there is a growing interest in
generating highlight reels for various forms of content, with tools like
ContentGroove, Valossa AI, and Pictory employing AI to generate
highlights. An example of real-world usage includes FOX Sports’ “Catch
Up with Highlights” feature, which utilized AWS Rekognition to create
automated highlights for the games played during the most recent soccer
World Cup.  
  
However, the existing tools in the market lack one crucial element –
AI-generated commentary integrated with the highlights. This idea
remains largely unexplored, and we believe there is significant
potential to develop a tool that can provide a competitive edge over
existing solutions. AI-generated highlights with AI-synthesized
commentary can greatly enhance the user experience by adding a
storytelling aspect and providing instantaneous analysis. This can offer
users insights that are not apparent with the highlights generated by
currently available tools.

# Use Cases

1.  User gives a video and has no options. This will create a highlight
    reel with commentary of a quarter-time

2.  User gives a video with no commentary. This will create a highlight
    reel with no commentary and video quarter length time

3.  User gives a video with the option of top 5 clips. The program will
    create the top 5 clips and send them to the user.

4.  Users give a pre-cut video, and the program will create commentary
    and provide the video with commentary.

# Requirements

-   Users should be able to upload a video of sports matches via a web
    portal without feedback explaining the progress of the upload to the
    user.

-   Users should have options to customize the end product, such as:

    -   The length of the final highlights reel

    -   Toggling the voiceover commentary on or off

    -   Specifying a specific number of clips to include in the
        highlight reels, etc.

-   The product should pick out key moments of the game and stitch
    together a highlights reel.

-   The product should intelligently generate commentary to add to the
    final highlights reel.

-   Users should be able to view the end product (highlights reel) upon
    completion of the processing in the web portal.

# Software Architecture

## Context Diagram

<img src="Context Diagram.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="image" />  

The context diagram describes the interaction between the user input and
our system. The user inputs a video feed for a sports game and provides
some user options, which can include the length of the highlights clip,
voiceover toggle, etc. Our software processes these inputs and provides
the user with a final highlight reel that can be downloaded/viewed.

## Component Diagram

The component diagram elaborates on the major parts of the
application.  
User Options: The User Options feature enables users to customize their
output preferences. Users can choose from options such as including
commentary, adding commentary only, or selecting only the top N
highlights. The default when given no options is a highlight reel with
commentary.  
Speech to Text Engine of Feed: Transcripts the commentary, so that it
can be utilized to analyze the game  
NLP on Commentary Transcript: Processing the transcripted commentary to
understand the core moments in the game. Given the timestamps for the
critical moment detector, it will cut the transcript to just that
critical moment, and provide analysis of the clip.  
Critical Moment Detector Algorithm: Utilizes the processed transcript as
well as analyzes characteristics of the feed to identify critical
moments’ timestamps  
Stitching Clips: Processes the original video based on the critical
moments’ timestamps to generate cuts and stitches. Additionally,
overlays the video with the AI-synthesized commentary once the critical
moments are analyzed.  
Generative AI for New Commentary: Using the critical moment analysis,
utilizing a LLM, generate new commentary for the clips  
Text to Speech Engine on new Commentary: Converts the text from the
Generative AI, to speech to overlay over the critical moment.

## Backend

Host the program on a web server, hosted on the cloud to give an
interface for users to input their videos and select options, while also
giving them an interface to get their generated video at the end.
