# Clipper

Last update: 04/12/2024

# Overview

Clipper is an application for generating highlights that employs a custom algorithm to identify key moments in a game. Furthermore, we generate AI-synthesized commentary to provide context to plays and enhance engagement. Our solution aims to address the current method of highlights selection, which requires substantial human effort and is both inconsistent and time-consuming.

## Setup and Installation

   ```bash

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
